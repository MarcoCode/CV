## Marco Bagnasco

I have always been split between a keen interest for music/communication and an innate passion for technology. After relocating to London, and completing a BA, I started helping with the management of a private Music School. In the future I see the possibility to teach and use technology as a mean to enhance human expression and communication. 
I am available to hire as a junior developer. 

## Skills

#### Web Development

Joining Makers Academy helped me understand the big picture, from coding best-practices to the right choice of technologies.
TDD and BDD experience, along with agile methodologies and pair programming sessions gave me the skills needed to contribute to well crafted software as part of a team.  
```
- Integrated my previous computer engineer experience with cutting-edge training
  at the European leading coding bootcamp.
- As part of a team of 5 developers, I contributed to the creation of a full-stack
  Music streaming service using AngularJs and Rails based API in less than 2 weeks. 
```
| Project Description        |    Link        | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Instagram clone as part of Week 7 week-end challenge, built using Ruby on Rails.     | [Pictagram] (https://https://picta-challenge.herokuapp.com) |
| As final project @Makers Academy, in a team of 5, we built a SPA music streaming service using AngularJS and Rails API.      | [FairMuse](https://github.com/marcocode/fairMuse) |   
|As part of Week 8, in a team of 4, we managed to build a web application that uses the GitHub API to search through its users. This project was done to learn AngularJs, and has been completed without prior knowledge of the framework. | [Github Profiler] (https://github.com/marcocode/githubProfiles)   |  
#### Team work

During my previous experiences and due to my relocation to London I came across a multitude of cultures and realities allowing my communication skills to be effective in many different scenarios. 
```
- I have learned to listen to the many non-verbal signals sent along verbal communication
  as a part of human interaction.
- I can be flexible in many roles inside a team, leading if necessary but willing to step back
  and support if that is what the situation requires. 
- I am proud of the achievements of the management / teachers team at Young Harmonisers UK,
  guiding young students in East London into learning a musical instrument.
